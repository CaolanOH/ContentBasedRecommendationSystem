    "## 1. Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Recommender systems are programs that use machine learning algorithms and techniques to take in data, process it, and return data that are similar based on the characteristics of the original input data. Recommender systems filter, prioritize and deliver relevant information. They help combat information overload, which is the excess of information a person can be exposed to, especially on the internet. To help with information overload, recommender systems have become widespread within the online retail and eCommerce industries, streaming services such as Netflix, Amazon, Hulu, and YouTube. Recommender Systems and algorithms are present in social media to populate new feeds and explore pages with new and relevant content.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Applications of AI\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.1 Robotics\n",
    "\n",
    "The best example of artificial intelligence and robotics integration is self-driving vehicles. The first successful display of autonomous vehicles was the 132-mile DARPA Grand challenge in 2005. An Autonomous vehicle drove on dirt roads. Waymo test vehicles achieved 10 million miles on public roads without any accidents in 2018. Waymo test vehicles used supervised artificial intelligence with a human driver assuming control every 6,000 miles. Tesla is the leading manufacturer of electric cars that utilize consumer-ready artificial intelligence self-driving software in their vehicles. The advantages of using artificial intelligence in vehicles are reduced accidents, higher traffic efficiency, and access to transport for physically impaired people (“Advantages and disadvantages of autonomous vehicles,” 2021). The limitations of this software and implementing artificial intelligence in cars, in general, is the high cost of implementation and production (“Advantages and disadvantages of autonomous vehicles,” 2021). Artificial intelligence drives up the price of vehicles and can alienate a portion of a company's consumer base. Companies will need to create software that is easily scalable and updatable over time which is new for the car industry. Artificial intelligence programs require a substantial amount of computational performance (“Advantages and disadvantages of autonomous vehicles,” 2021). This can be an issue because the computer portion of the vehicle must share power and space, and other resources with the mechanical components of the vehicle.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.1 Finance\n",
    "\n",
    "Artificial Intelligence is used within the finance industry for risk assessment and management, fraud detection, credit decisions, and trading. Banks are utilizing machine learning to assess and determine whether applications are suitable candidates for loans. Artificial intelligence is used to analyse a  person’s buying behaviour and flag possible fraudulent behaviour (“Artificial Intelligence in Finance [15 Examples],” 2021). Artificial intelligence analyses large trading datasets to predict market trends and behaviours. The main limitations of artificial in finance revolve around privacy, cost, and misuse of data. When it comes to trading and artificial intelligence cannot beat human intuition or common sense. Outside of customer care chatbots, a lot of ai software used in finance is supervised.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.1 Medicine\n",
    "\n",
    "Artificial intelligence in the Healthcare sector is beginning to be used in numerous ways. Artificial intelligence is used in different ways to diagnose and reduce human error, much like artificial intelligence in cars. It is used in cancer diagnosis, general illness diagnosis, intelligent symptom checkers, and developing new medicines. Companies now specialize in developing new drugs using artificial intelligence. Berg Health uses artificial intelligence to scan vast amounts of data and map diseases to accelerate the development of medicines (“37 Examples of AI in Healthcare That Will Make You Feel Better About the Future,” 2014). Bioxcel Therapeutics uses artificial intelligence to find new applications for existing drugs (“37 Examples of AI in Healthcare That Will Make You Feel Better About the Future,” 2014).\n",

    "\n",
    "## 3. Recommender Systems\n",
    "\n",
    "Recommender systems can be split into three main types. Demographic/Popularity-Based, Content-based and Collaborative-based systems. \n",
    "\n",
    "### 3.1 Content-Based Approach\n",
    "\n",
    ">**2.Content Based Filtering** - Suggests similar items based on a particular item (ibtesama, 2020). For example, content-based filtering would use item metadata and characteristics of a movie database such as genre, descriptions, and actors. It uses the features of the movie to make these recommendations. The general idea behind these recommender systems is that if a person likes a particular item, they will also want an item with similar characteristics and metadata.\n",
    "\n",
    "The content-based approach is based on a semantic search. This semantic search is primarily for information retrieval(ibtesama, 2020). Suppose a user liked a particular film with a specific director or a book by a particular author. In that case, the content-based approach will analyse the desired item and return movies or books by the same director or author with similar plot descriptions or blurbs. Content-based filtering gives exclusive ratings and results based on the user's input. The model doesn't need any data about other users, since the recommendations are specific to this user. This makes it easier to scale to a large number of users (“Content-based Filtering Advantages & Disadvantages,” 2018).\n",
    "\n",
    "The quality of content-based filtering also depends on the quality of data and its attributes. Some data, for example, books and book reviews, work very well with a content-based approach. Content-based filtering can draw on a book's author, blurb, description, themes, and publisher to find similarities and present recommendations from that. If the dataset lacks sufficient attributes or creating the characteristics of an item is difficult, then the content-based approach will not perform well. The content-based approach does not take in interaction data. It only uses statistical data. The has limited ability to expand on the user's existing interest (“Content-based Filtering Advantages & Disadvantages,” 2018).\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3.2 Collaborative Approach\n",
    "\n",
    ">**2.Collaborative Filtering** - Collaborative filtering uses similarities between users and items simultaneously to provide recommendations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Collaborative filtering only needs a user's historical preference on a set of data. Collaborative filtering focuses on the relationship between user and item. The system uses information from data collection and other user interactions (\"Content-based Filtering Advantages & Disadvantages,\" 2018). The system recommends items based on the similarity rating of those items by users who have rated both items.  Collaborative filtering follows the logic that if user A likes the exact item as user B, then user A is likely to like another item picked by user B (\"A Simple Introduction to Collaborative Filtering,\" 2019). Unlike content-based filtering, collaborative filtering can help users discover new things. \n",
    "\n",
    "Collaborative filtering can be split into two types, user-based and item-based. User-based collaborative filtering recommends items to a user that similar users have liked. This is done using a Pearson correlation or cosine similarity score (ibtesama, 2020). Item-based collaborative filtering compairs the similarity of items the user has already rated. A Pearson correlation or cosine similarity is used to compute this similarity too (ibtesama, 2020).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## 4. Programming Book Recommender System\n",
    "\n",
    "The recommend system created for this report recommends programming books. The Data set used is the Top 270 Computer Science / Programing Books. This dataset store :\n",
    "\n",
    "- Book Title\n",
    "- Description\n",
    "- Number of pages\n",
    "- Type (Hardback, paperback etc)\n",

    ">**[The source for this dataset can be found here](https://www.kaggle.com/thomaskonstantin/top-270-rated-computer-science-programing-books)**\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4.1 Description\n",
    "\n",
    "This recommender system will compute pairwise similarity scores for all the programming books based on their descriptions. The system will then recommend books based on this similarity score. \n",
    "\n",
    "### 4.2 Implementation\n",
    "\n",
    "- The first step of building this recommender system is to import the python packages and datasets that this system will be working with. Pandas is an open-source software library used for data manipulation and analysis. \n",
    "- Numpy is a scientific computing library for manipulating large data sets. \n",
    "- Scikit-learn is a machine learning library. This recommender system specifically uses the Tfidfvectorizer from it. \n",
    "- The dataset is read using the pandas function read_csv(), and the dataset is passed in. The dataset is assigned to the variable books, and the books variable is then printed to show the data.\n"
